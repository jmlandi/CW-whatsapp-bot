Intial decision Tree, `created on Figma`. It's not exactly the way the bot was created, but this flow gave me a north on my developing.

## Assistant 🤖
I created Bruno with OpenAi API using the `Threads` and `Completions` resources. His knowledge is not big, as my intention was to create a flow with minimum costs, but he can solve silly doubts.
